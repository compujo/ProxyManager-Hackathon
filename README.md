Proxy manager (sort by response time and autoconnect) made for the iJet 2014 Hackathon

The backend server is kinda crappy but the source code is provided under src/backend. To have the program connect to a different backend server you'll have to change and recompile the executable with autohotkey.


The dependencies require Ruby which is obtainable at http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

Use at own risk.
